<h1>My Database </h1>
<h3>Developed with Django, sqLite and bootstrap | WIP </h3>

<p>To use the program you have to create an account. The program uses Django's built-in authentication for making accounts. </p>
<hr>
<p>Every account can make 5 personalized lists. These are not available to any other user. \n 
   For now the best use case for this program is to make To-Do lists, where you can either check off,delete or modify the items that you have added. 
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Functions to be added:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Login with the use of the authlib library</li>
  <li>Adding the models for new coloumns with name and datatype. Adding the model for data. This will make it possible for the user to make tables with new personalized coloumns,
  where they can choose their preferred datatype for each coloumn themselves. </li>
  <li>Example for a new database structure: ![img](https://github.com/SinaJaha/django-program/assets/111735256/9a186d62-aaa7-42a3-a652-c904d1a5530e)
